Here let's conduct two simulations of correlation.

First, we generate (data generating process) a regression: y = 4 + 1.2*x + e with 600 obersvations. The error term (e) is generated from rnorm function for random numebr with normal distribution with mean of 10 and standard deviation of 5.

```{r}
x=rnorm(600, mean=10, sd=5)
y=4+1.2*x+rnorm(600, mean=0, sd=2)
plot(x,y,pch=20)
abline(lm(y ~ x), col="blue", lwd=3)
grid()
```

Second, we generate two series with normal distrbution but no correaltion with each other.

```{r}
x1=rnorm(600, mean=10, sd=5)
y1=rnorm(600, mean=0, sd=2)
plot(x1,y1, pch=20)
abline(lm(y1 ~ x1), col="blue", lwd=2)
grid()
```

Now let's run the linear regression results for these two simulations.

```{r}
fit=lm(y~x)
fit2=lm(y1~x1)
summary(fit)
summary(fit2)
```
